# CTCI
Contains my solutions to the coding exercises given in "Cracking the Coding Interview (6th edition)" book.
These are not the book solutions. The solutions here are what I initially thought and coded before referencing the book.
If I was unable to think of an answer, then I obviously had to consult the book solution. In that case, you will find a solution similar to that in this repository.

## Programming Languages ##

I have used java and python to solve the questions. You will find java solutions for all questions and python solutions for some of them.

## Note ##
I am still reading the book and working on the repository. I will continue to add solutions as and when I get time.
